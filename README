Perthon v.0.1 - Python to Perl language translation

Perthon attempts to translate Python source code into
human-readable Perl source code.

Refer to http://perthon.sourceforge.net for the latest project information.

(NOTE: This is pre-pre-alpha software.)

Example usage:

  perl perthon.pl ex/test1.py

or (to both translate and run)

  perl perthon.pl ex/test2.py | perl

Features:

- Perthon is a Perl module and is written entirely in Perl 5.x.
  It is platform independent.
- Perthon uses the Damian Conway's Parse::RecDescent Perl module
  (http://search.cpan.org/~dconway/Parse-RecDescent/) for language parsing.
- Perthon reimplements the Python language as specified in the
  Python Reference Manual and BNF grammar
  (http://www.python.org/doc/current/ref/ref.html).
- Perthon allows Python code to be run on the Perl 5.x interpreter,
  which is similar to how Jython (www.jython.org) reimplements Python
  on the JVM, except that Perthon works at the source code (not byte code)
  level.  Jython is more analogous to the work underway to reimplement
  Python on the Parrot virtual machine(http://www.parrotcode.org/) that
  it is to Perthon.
- Perthon does the reverse of Bridgekeeper
  (http://www.crazy-compilers.com/bridgekeeper/), which attempts the
  (much harder) problem of Perl to Python source code machine translation.
